# Typo3 Setup procedure README
This project aims at providing a thorough procedure to set up a Typo3 installation from scratch. Although most of the information collected here can be found all around the web, it consumes a fair amount of time picking the needed cherries.

In the 1st phase a fair amount of information will be organized in the file ``README.SetupProcedure.md`` to identify the results we want to achieve, so we can develop the needed scripts from there. The information therein is by no means static, as it will evolve over time and reflect the changes in the scripts.
